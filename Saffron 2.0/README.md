# Saffron-2.0
Saffron is a preprocessor which serves as a front end for JSAT. Saffron is to JSAT as a higher level language is to an assembler. The user expresses his/her problem by writing a Java application using the Saffron API. When the application is run, Saffron creates a corresponding SAT problem, then applies the JSAT API to find a solution. The JSAT solution is analyzed by Saffron, and the bit assignments provided by JSAT are used to construct the solution values of the original problem.
